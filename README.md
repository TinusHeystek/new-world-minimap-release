## New world minimap
This tool is a resource minimap for New World that shows the resources listed on https://www.newworld-map.com/ . This Minimap could be used to assist you in finding and discovering resources near your current location. It is not meant to replace the In-Game Map or Compass, it is a tool like any other online resource website that shows and documents resource nodes in Aeternum.

Developed after the Close Beta, the Minimap is an assisted tool great for those Player that only have one
Monitor or dislikes Tabbing out of the game just to find that next Iron Ore node  

## Setup
No Tool is without some setup, so here are the requirement: currently it has only been tested on Windows 10 and running the game at full screen resolution. It only works on your "Primary Monitor/Display". If you just only see a Black screen and the Minimap, aka "no transparency" just close and re-open the application, **preview**, remember ðŸ˜…
### How does it know where I am ?
For this application to work you need to enable the "Show FPS" settings in the "Visuals" sub menu of the In-Game Settings screen. this shows your Character's current location in the world.
By using the (limited) **power of OCR** (Optical Character Recognition) the application tries its best to read
your position from the values in the Top Left Corner of your screen and updates the Minimap to your location. if you are using a different screen resolution than 1920x1080 you will need to move the "Capture Area" in the Minimap Settings menu (at position 1 in image below.)

**There are multiple option and filters available to customise your position and scale of the Mimimap:**  
â€¢ 1. Openthe Settings menu by clicking on the yellow gear Icon shown at position "1". once the menu is open you will be able to click and drag the Minimap on the screen to move it wherever you want. you can also use the Scale slider to make it bigger or smaller.  
â€¢ 2. Like I mentioned earlier it uses the "NewWorldFans' Map" to pinpoint the resource location so a quick link button to their Web Site can be located at position "2'.  
â€¢ 3. Don't want to Show the Minimap anymore? (because you are in Town having a nice conversation with the NPC's or in a Dungeon) Press the button at position "3" to show/hide the Minimap.(ps. if you screwed anything up with the settings and the Minimap is gone or not working anymore Hold "Ctrl + left Click" this button to reset the settings to default.)  
â€¢ 4. Zoom In or Out to see resources far away or pinpoint them right next to you.  
â€¢ 5. Some basic filtering is also provided. click any of the buttons at position "5" to show/hide resource types and only show what you are looking for. (Current options are "Creature and Named Enemy" locations, "All Ore" locations, "All Plantlife" locations, "All Essence" locations and "All Chests and Document" locations)
